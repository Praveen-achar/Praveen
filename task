DevOps is important because it's a software development and operations approach that enables faster development of new products and easier maintenance of existing deployments.

The practice of DevOps encourages smoother, continuous communication, collaboration, integration, visibility, and transparency between application development teams (Dev) and their IT operations team (Ops) counterparts

It helps teams automate processes and reduce rework as well as reduce waste processes that we perform everyday and is of no need.
